            <h3>Mission</h3>
Over the past three decades, HEP has successfully leveraged AI across numerous aspects,
including data analysis, real-time data selection, detector calibration/monitoring, and theory calculations.
It is essential to the future of the field that it fully exploits its potential.
Establishing a UK AI HEP framework allows to overcome common barriers and challenges
while harnessing opportunities in areas such as hardware, software, AI-ops, skills/training,
knowledge exchange, capacity building, industry engagement, and fast-AI.
<br><br>
Our goal is to bring together researchers across experiment, theory/phenomenology,
but also computing and software experts, to review progress,
identify barriers and opportunities for enabling AI in HEP, sharing tools,
promoting successful use-cases, and improving skills/training and knowledge transfer.
